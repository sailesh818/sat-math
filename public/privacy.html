  <h1>Privacy Policy for SAT Math</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 18 November 2024 (Updated February 2025)</p>

  <p>SAT Math (“we”, “our”, or “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how the SAT Math mobile application (“App”) handles user information.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>The App may use Firebase Authentication and Cloud Firestore for optional login and to save your progress and rewarded points. The App also uses Google Mobile Ads (AdMob) to display ads.</p>
  <p>Specifically, the App may handle:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Email address or basic profile (only if you sign in)</li>
    <li>Progress data and rewarded points stored in Cloud Firestore</li>
    <li>Advertising ID (used by Google Mobile Ads)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect or share personally identifiable information beyond these purposes.</p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Firebase Authentication: optional login and account management</li>
    <li>Cloud Firestore: saving and restoring your progress and rewarded points</li>
    <li>Google Mobile Ads: displaying rewarded, banner, and interstitial ads</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Your data is never sold or shared with third parties beyond these services.</p>

  <h2>3. Advertising ID (AD_ID)</h2>
  <p>Because we show ads, the App requires access to your Advertising ID to deliver ads properly on Android 13 or later. We do not use this ID for tracking, analytics, or personalization beyond what Google provides.</p>

  <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>SAT Math is suitable for users of all ages, including children.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>No personal data is collected from children by default</li>
    <li>Optional Firebase login is entirely voluntary</li>
    <li>The App is fully functional without providing personal information</li>
    <li>Complies with child privacy laws such as COPPA</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Firebase: authentication and data storage for progress/rewarded points</li>
    <li>Google Mobile Ads (AdMob): advertising functionality using Advertising ID</li>
  </ul>
  <p>No other third-party SDKs or analytics tools are used.</p>

  <h2>6. Security</h2>
  <p>Firebase data is stored securely according to Google standards. Locally stored data on your device is protected, and we recommend keeping your device secure.</p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. Any changes will appear on this page with an updated “Effective Date”.</p>
