    "correctIndex": 3,
    "hint": "Slope formula: m = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1).",
    "explanation": "Slope = (5 - (-3)) / (-4 - 2) = 8 / -6 = -4/3"

    "correctIndex": 1,
    "hint": "Distance formula: √[(x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²].",
    "explanation": "Distance = √[(-5 -1)² + (-4 -2)²] = √[36 + 36] = √72"

    "hint": "Midpoint formula: ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2).",
    "explanation": "Midpoint = ((-2+6)/2, (7+(-1))/2) = (4/2, 6/2) = (2,3)"

    "correctIndex": 1,
    "hint": "Convert to slope-intercept form y = mx + b.",
    "explanation": "3x - 4y + 7 = 0 → -4y = -3x -7 → y = 3/4 x + 7/4 → slope = 3/4"

    "hint": "Check if slopes between pairs are equal.",
    "explanation": "Slope between (1,2) & (3,6) = (6-2)/(3-1) = 4/2 = 2, slope between (3,6) & (5,10) = (10-6)/(5-3) = 4/2 = 2 → same slope → collinear"
