    "options": ["30", "25", "35", "32"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Area = 1/2 * base * height",
    "explanation": "Base = 5, height = 12 → Area = 1/2 * 5 * 12 = 30"

    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Use Pythagoras with half the chord as one leg and the distance as another leg.",
    "explanation": "Half chord = 7 → r² = 7² + 4² = 49 + 16 = 65 → r = √65"
