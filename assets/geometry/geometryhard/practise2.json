    "question": "1. A circle has a sector with an area of 36π square units and a radius of 6. Find the central angle of the sector in radians.",
    "options": ["1", "2", "3", "π"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Area of a sector = (1/2)r²θ, where r is the radius and θ is the central angle in radians.",
    "explanation": "36π = (1/2)*6²*θ → 36π = 18θ → θ = 2"

    "options": ["150", "140", "120", "100"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Area of a regular hexagon = (3√3/2) * s², where s is the side length, and s = radius for an inscribed hexagon.",
    "explanation": "Area = (3√3/2) * 10² = 150"

    "options": ["12", "14", "16", "18"],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "hint": "Use the formula for the area of a triangle with vertices (x₁, y₁), (x₂, y₂), (x₃, y₃): Area = 1/2 * |x₁(y₂ - y₃) + x₂(y₃ - y₁) + x₃(y₁ - y₂)|",
    "explanation": "Area = 1/2 * |1(5 - 2) + 4(2 - 1) + 7(1 - 5)| = 14"

    "options": ["180π", "200π", "150π", "250π"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Surface area of a cone = πr(r + l), where r is the radius and l is the slant height.",
    "explanation": "Surface area = π*6*(6 + 10) = 180π"

    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Use the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions: a² + b² + c² = d², where a, b, and c are the sides and d is the diagonal.",
    "explanation": "5² + 12² + c² = 13² → 25 + 144 + c² = 169 → c² = 0 → c = 10"
