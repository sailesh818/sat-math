    "question": "1. A triangle has vertices at (2, 3), (6, 7), and (8, 5). Find its area.",
    "options": ["12", "14", "16", "18"],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "hint": "Use the formula for the area of a triangle with vertices (x₁, y₁), (x₂, y₂), (x₃, y₃): Area = 1/2 * |x₁(y₂ - y₃) + x₂(y₃ - y₁) + x₃(y₁ - y₂)|",
    "explanation": "Area = 1/2 * |2(7 - 5) + 6(5 - 3) + 8(3 - 7)| = 14"

    "question": "2. A regular octagon is inscribed in a circle with radius 10. Find the area of the octagon.",
    "options": ["200", "250", "300", "350"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Area of a regular octagon = 2 * (1 + √2) * r², where r is the radius of the circumscribed circle.",
    "explanation": "Area = 2 * (1 + √2) * 10² = 200"

    "options": ["10", "12", "13", "15"],
    "correctIndex": 2,
    "hint": "Use the 3D Pythagorean theorem: d² = l² + w² + h²",
    "explanation": "d² = 5² + 6² + 8² = 25 + 36 + 64 = 125 → d = 13"

    "question": "4. A cone has a slant height of 13 units and a radius of 5 units. Find its surface area.",
    "options": ["170π", "180π", "190π", "200π"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Surface area of a cone = πr(r + l), where r is the radius and l is the slant height.",
    "explanation": "Surface area = π*5*(5 + 13) = 170π"

    "options": ["15", "16", "17", "18"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the radius.",
    "explanation": "The half-length of the chord is 12, so the radius r satisfies: 12² + 9² = r² → r = 15"
