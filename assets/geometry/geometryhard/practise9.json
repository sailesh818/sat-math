    "options": ["6", "8", "10", "12"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Volume = (1/3)πr²h",
    "explanation": "72π = (1/3)π*6²*h → h = 72π / (1/3)π*36 = 6"

    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Use the Pythagorean theorem: c² = a² + b²",
    "explanation": "c² = 5² + 12² = 25 + 144 = 169 → c = √169 = 13"
