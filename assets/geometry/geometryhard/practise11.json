    "question": "1. The length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism is 14 units. If the dimensions of the prism are 6, 8, and x, find the value of x.",
    "options": ["12", "13", "14", "15"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Use Pythagoras in three dimensions: d² = l² + w² + h²",
    "explanation": "14² = 6² + 8² + x² → 196 = 36 + 64 + x² → x² = 96 → x = 12"

    "options": ["90°", "120°", "150°", "180°"],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "hint": "Sector area = (θ/360) * π * r²",
    "explanation": "24π = (θ/360) * π * 6² → 24 = (θ/360) * 36 → θ = 120°"

    "options": ["5π/3", "5π/6", "5π/2", "5π/4"],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "hint": "Arc length = (θ/360) * 2πr",
    "explanation": "Arc length = (60/360) * 2π * 5 = (1/6) * 10π = 5π/3"

    "hint": "Volume of cube = side³",
    "explanation": "Volume = 27 → side³ = 27 → side = 3"

    "options": ["48π", "50π", "52π", "56π"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Volume = (1/3) * π * r² * h",

    "options": ["6", "8", "9", "10"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Area = π * r²",
    "explanation": "36π = π * r² → r² = 36 → r = 6"
