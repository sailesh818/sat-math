    "question": "1. In a triangle, two sides are 7 and 24, and the angle between them is 90°. Find the area.",
    "options": ["84", "72", "60", "80"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Use formula: Area = 1/2 * base * height",
    "explanation": "Area = 1/2*7*24=84"

    "question": "2. A rectangle has diagonal 10 and width 6. Find its length.",
    "options": ["8", "7", "6", "9"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Use Pythagoras theorem: diagonal² = length² + width²",
    "explanation": "Length² + 6² = 10² → Length²=64 → Length=8"

    "options": ["9", "6", "12", "8"],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "hint": "Circumference = 2πr",
    "explanation": "2πr = 18π → r=9"

    "hint": "Sum of angles in triangle = 180°",
    "explanation": "180 - 50 - 60 = 70°"
