    "options": ["6", "5", "4", "3"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "It's a right triangle; use (1/2)*base*height.",
    "explanation": "Area = 1/2 * 3 * 4 = 6"

    "options": ["14", "10", "12", "16"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Perimeter = 2*(length + width)",
    "explanation": "Perimeter = 2*(5+2) = 14"

    "question": "3. If an angle in a triangle is 90°, and the other two angles are equal, what is the measure of each of the other two angles?",
    "options": ["45°", "60°", "30°", "50°"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Sum of angles in a triangle is 180°",
    "explanation": "180 - 90 = 90; divide by 2 → 45° each"
