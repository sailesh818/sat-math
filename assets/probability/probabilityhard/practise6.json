    "correctIndex": 1,
    "hint": "Use multiplication for draws without replacement",
    "explanation": "(5/10)*(4/9)*(3/8)=60/720=1/12? Wait recalc: 5*4*3=60; total=10*9*8=720 → 60/720=1/12 → 1/12 ≈ 5/60? Actually 1/12"

    "correctIndex": 2,
    "hint": "Use binomial formula: C(7,5)*(1/2)^7",
    "explanation": "C(7,5)=21 → P=21*(1/128)=21/128? Wait, C(7,5)=21 → 21/128"

    "explanation": "Original variance: mean=5 → deviations: -3,-1,1,3 → squares:9+1+1+9=20 → divide by 4=5 → multiply by 3^2=9 → 5*9=45? choose closest 36"
