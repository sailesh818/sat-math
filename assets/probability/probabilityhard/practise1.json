    "question": "1. A box contains 5 red, 4 blue, and 3 green balls. Two balls are drawn without replacement. Probability both are red?",
    "options": ["1/11", "5/33", "2/11", "5/22"],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "hint": "Use probability multiplication: P(R1 and R2) = P(R1)*P(R2|R1)",
    "explanation": "P(first red)=5/12, P(second red)=4/11 → 5/12*4/11=20/132=5/33"

    "question": "2. A fair die is rolled 3 times. Probability sum = 9?",

    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "List all combinations of three numbers summing to 9",
    "explanation": "Combinations: (1,2,6),(1,3,5),(1,4,4),(2,1,6)... total 25 → 25/216"

    "options": ["5", "6", "4", "7"],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "hint": "Sum = mean × count",
    "explanation": "Sum=8*6=48 → sum of first 5=41 → x=48−41=7 → correctIndex=3"

    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Without replacement: P(K1)*P(K2|K1)",
    "explanation": "4/52 * 3/51 = 12/2652 = 1/221"
