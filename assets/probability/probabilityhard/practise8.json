    "question": "1. Bag: 5 red, 7 blue, 8 green. Draw 3 without replacement. Probability all different colors?",
    "options": ["35/114", "5/38", "10/57", "7/114"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Use combinations: favorable/total",
    "explanation": "Favorable: 5*7*8=280; total C(20,3)=1140 → 280/1140=35/114"

    "options": ["10/32", "5/16", "5/32", "1/4"],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "hint": "Binomial probability C(5,3)*(1/2)^5",
    "explanation": "C(5,3)=10 → 10*(1/32)=10/32=5/16"

    "options": ["-10", "-5", "-9", "-8"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Mean scales linearly with multiplier",
    "explanation": "Original mean=5 → -2*5=-10"

    "hint": "Odd sum occurs when one die even, other odd",
    "explanation": "Half the outcomes sum to odd → 18/36=1/2"
