    "question": "1. A box contains 8 red and 12 blue balls. One ball is drawn at random. What is the probability it is red?",
    "options": ["2/5", "1/2", "1/3", "3/5"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Probability = favorable / total",
    "explanation": "Total balls = 8+12=20 → P(red)=8/20=2/5"

    "question": "2. A coin is tossed 5 times. Probability of getting exactly 3 heads?",
    "options": ["5/16", "5/32", "10/32", "1/2"],
    "correctIndex": 2,
    "hint": "Use binomial probability: C(n,k)*(1/2)^k*(1/2)^(n-k)",
    "explanation": "C(5,3)*(1/2)^3*(1/2)^2=10*(1/32)=10/32"

    "options": ["16.3", "16.4", "16.5", "16.6"],
    "correctIndex": 2,
    "hint": "New mean = (sum + new value) / new count",
    "explanation": "Original sum = 16*10=160 → new sum=160+20=180 → new mean=180/11≈16.36 → rounded=16.5"

    "question": "4. The probability of raining on a day is 0.3. What is the probability it does not rain?",
    "options": ["0.7", "0.3", "0.5", "0.6"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "P(not rain) = 1 - P(rain)",
    "explanation": "1 - 0.3 = 0.7"

    "question": "5. A bag contains 4 yellow and 6 green balls. Two balls are drawn with replacement. Probability both are yellow?",
    "options": ["2/25", "4/25", "1/5", "8/25"],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "hint": "With replacement, multiply probabilities",
    "explanation": "P(yellow)=4/10 → both = 4/10 * 4/10 = 16/100=4/25"
