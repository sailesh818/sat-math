    "options": ["1/6", "1/5", "1/8", "1/12"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Count favorable outcomes",
    "explanation": "Favorable: (1,6),(2,5),(3,4),(4,3),(5,2),(6,1) → 6/36=1/6"

    "options": ["0.2", "0.3", "0.1", "0.4"],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "hint": "P(neither)=1−P(tea∪coffee)",
    "explanation": "P(tea∪coffee)=0.4+0.5−0.2=0.7 → P(neither)=1−0.7=0.3"

    "correctIndex": 1,
    "hint": "Use sum=mean*count",
    "explanation": "Sum=14*5=70 → 10+12+15+18+x=70 → x=15 → 10+12+15+18+15=70 → correct x=16"

    "hint": "Use complement: 1-P(all heads)",
    "explanation": "P(all heads)=(1/2)^3=1/8 → P(at least one tail)=1−1/8=7/8"

    "hint": "P(girl) = girls/total",
