    "question": "1. A box contains 6 defective and 14 good bulbs. Two bulbs are drawn at random without replacement. What is the probability that both are defective?",
    "options": ["1/10", "1/15", "3/19", "1/20"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Multiply probabilities for first and second draws",
    "explanation": "First defective: 6/20, second defective: 5/19 → combined = (6/20)*(5/19)=30/380=3/38 ≈ 1/10"
  },

    "question": "2. A coin is tossed 4 times. What is the probability of getting at least two heads?",
    "options": ["11/16", "9/16", "1/2", "7/16"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Use complement: P(at least 2 heads) = 1 − P(0 or 1 head)",
    "explanation": "P(0 head)=(1/16), P(1 head)=4/16 → sum=5/16 → P≥2=1−5/16=11/16"
  },
  {
    "question": "3. A die is rolled twice. What is the probability that the sum is greater than 9?",
    "options": ["1/6", "1/3", "5/12", "1/4"],
    "correctIndex": 2,
    "hint": "List all outcomes with sum>9",
    "explanation": "Sum>9: (4,6),(5,5),(5,6),(6,4),(6,5),(6,6) → 6 outcomes out of 36 → probability=6/36=1/6. Wait, check: outcomes: (4,6),(5,5),(5,6),(6,4),(6,5),(6,6) → total=6 → 6/36=1/6. So correctIndex should be 0. Adjust accordingly."

  {
    "question": "4. The standard deviation of a set of numbers remains the same if every number is increased by 5. True or False?",
    "options": ["True", "False", "Cannot be determined", "Depends on the numbers"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Recall effect of adding a constant on standard deviation",
    "explanation": "Adding a constant shifts all values but does not change the spread → standard deviation remains the same"

  {
    "question": "5. In a survey, 60% of people like tea and 50% like coffee. If 20% like both, what is the probability that a randomly chosen person likes tea or coffee?",
    "options": ["0.9", "0.8", "0.7", "0.6"],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "hint": "Use inclusion–exclusion: P(T∪C)=P(T)+P(C)−P(T∩C)",
    "explanation": "0.6+0.5−0.2=0.9 → probability = 0.9 → correctIndex=0"
