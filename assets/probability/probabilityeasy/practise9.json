    "question": "1. A bag contains 1 red, 2 blue, and 3 green balls. A ball is drawn at random. What is the probability it is not green?",
    "options": ["1/2", "3/6", "2/3", "1/3"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Not green = red or blue count / total",
    "explanation": "Red + Blue = 1+2 = 3, total = 6 → 3/6 = 1/2"
  },
  {
    "question": "2. A single six‑sided die is rolled. What is the probability of getting a 1 or a 2?",
    "options": ["1/3", "1/6", "2/3", "1/2"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Count favorable outcomes / total outcomes",
    "explanation": "2 favorable (1 or 2) out of 6 → 2/6 = 1/3"

    "question": "3. A class has 16 students. The mean score is 85. If one student scored 95, what is the mean of the remaining 15 students?",
    "options": ["84", "83", "82", "80"],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "hint": "Total sum minus one score, divide by remainder",
    "explanation": "Total sum = 16×85 = 1360. Minus 95 → 1265. Mean = 1265 / 15 ≈ 84.333 → ≈ 83"

    "question": "4. A coin is tossed twice. What is the probability of getting at least one head?",
    "options": ["3/4", "1/2", "1/4", "2/3"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Compute 1 − probability(no heads)",
    "explanation": "Probability no heads (both tails) = 1/4 → so at least one head = 1 − 1/4 = 3/4"
  },
  {
    "question": "5. There are 7 boys and 5 girls in a group. One person is chosen at random. What is the probability the person is a girl?",
    "options": ["5/12", "7/12", "1/2", "5/7"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Favorable / total",
    "explanation": "5 girls / (7+5) = 5/12"
