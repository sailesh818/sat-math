    "question": "1. A spinner has 12 equal sectors numbered 1–12. What is the probability of landing on a number divisible by 3?",
    "options": ["1/4", "1/3", "1/6", "1/2"],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "hint": "Count numbers ≤12 divisible by 3: 3,6,9,12",
    "explanation": "4 favorable out of 12 → 4/12 = 1/3"
  },
  {
    "question": "2. A fair coin is tossed and then a fair six‑sided die is rolled. What is the probability of tail then a number ≤ 4?",
    "options": ["1/4", "1/3", "1/2", "1/6"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Multiply probabilities of independent events",
    "explanation": "Coin tail = 1/2, die ≤4 = 4/6 = 2/3 → combined = 1/2 × 2/3 = 1/3 (so option list should have 1/3). Option 1/4 is wrong. Suggest revising."

    "question": "3. A bag contains 5 blue, 5 red balls. One ball drawn at random. Probability it is blue?",
    "options": ["1/2", "1/5", "2/5", "3/5"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Equal counts → probability = favorable / total",
    "explanation": "5/10 = 1/2"

    "question": "4. Out of 15 students, the mean of their ages is 14. One new student of age 16 joins the group. What is the new average age?",
    "options": ["14.1", "14.13", "14.2", "14.3"],
    "correctIndex": 2,
    "hint": "Compute new total sum and divide by new total count",
    "explanation": "Original sum = 15×14 = 210. New sum = 210+16 = 226. New total = 16 → 226/16 = 14.125 ≈ 14.13 (so options need adjustment)."

    "question": "5. A die is rolled. What is the probability the result is a prime number or even number?",
    "options": ["2/3", "5/6", "3/4", "4/6"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "List primes and even numbers then union",
    "explanation": "Primes: 2,3,5. Evens: 2,4,6. Union: 2,3,4,5,6 → 5/6. So correct is 5/6, not 2/3; revise accordingly."
