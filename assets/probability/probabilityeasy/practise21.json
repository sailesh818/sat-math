    "question": "1. A bag contains 5 purple, 5 orange, and 5 white balls. One ball is drawn at random. What is the probability it is not white?",
    "options": ["10/15", "2/3", "1/3", "5/15"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Exclude white balls from total",
    "explanation": "Purple + Orange = 10 out of 15 total → 10/15 = 2/3"
  },

    "question": "2. A fair coin is flipped 2 times. What is the probability of getting exactly one tail?",
    "options": ["1/2", "1/4", "3/4", "1/3"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Possible outcomes: HH, HT, TH, TT",
    "explanation": "Favorable: HT, TH → 2/4 = 1/2"
  },

    "question": "3. A six‑sided die is rolled. What is the probability of rolling a 2 or a 4 or a 6?",
    "options": ["1/2", "1/3", "1/6", "2/3"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Count favorable even outcomes",
    "explanation": "3 favorable out of 6 → 3/6 = 1/2"

    "question": "4. In a class of 36 students, 18 passed math, 24 passed English. 10 students passed both. If one student is chosen randomly, what is the probability they passed at least one subject?",
    "options": ["(18+24−10)/36", "1", "2/3", "3/4"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Use inclusion–exclusion for union of events",
    "explanation": "(18 + 24 − 10) / 36 = 32/36 = 8/9"
  },
  {
    "question": "5. The average of 8 numbers is 25. If one number is 35, what is the average of the remaining 7 numbers?",
    "options": ["23", "24", "22.5", "24.5"],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "hint": "Compute total sum, subtract one number, divide by remaining",
    "explanation": "Total sum = 8×25 = 200. Remaining sum = 200−35 = 165 → mean = 165/7 ≈ 23.571 ≈ 24"
