    "question": "1. A fair coin is pushed into a hat 3 times (same coin). What is the probability that exactly two tosses show tails?",
    "options": ["3/8", "1/4", "1/2", "3/4"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Use combinations: C(3,2) favourable outcomes out of 2^3 total",
    "explanation": "C(3,2)=3 favourable outcomes out of 8 → 3/8"

    "question": "2. A bag has 7 balls numbered 1 to 7. One ball is drawn at random. What is the probability it is an odd number?",
    "options": ["4/7", "3/7", "1/2", "1/7"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Count odd numbers between 1 and 7",
    "explanation": "Odd numbers: 1,3,5,7 → 4 favourable / 7 total = 4/7"

    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Numbers ≥4 are 4,5,6",

    "options": ["5/8", "3/4", "2/5", "1/2"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Passed / total",
    "explanation": "25/40 = 5/8"

    "question": "5. The mean of 5 numbers is 16. If four numbers are 12, 18, 14, and 20, what is the fifth number?",
    "options": ["16", "18", "14", "12"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Sum = mean × count",
    "explanation": "Total sum = 5×16 = 80. Sum of known = 64 → fifth = 80−64 = 16"
