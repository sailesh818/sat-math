    "question": "1. A bag contains 2 red, 3 blue, and 5 yellow balls. One ball is drawn randomly. What is the probability it is red or yellow?",
    "options": ["7/10", "1/2", "5/10", "3/10"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Add red and yellow outcomes over total",
    "explanation": "(2 + 5) / 10 = 7/10"

    "options": ["1/4", "1/2", "1/8", "1/6"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Use combinations: C(4,3) favorable outcomes",
    "explanation": "C(4,3)=4 favorable out of 16 total → 4/16 = 1/4"

    "options": ["1/4", "1/3", "1/2", "1/6"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Independent events: multiply probabilities",

    "options": ["2/5", "3/5", "1/2", "4/5"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Favorable / total",

    "options": ["10", "9", "8", "11"],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "hint": "Sum = average × count → subtract known sum",
    "explanation": "Total sum = 6×9 = 54. Known sum = 8+10+7+11+9 = 45 → sixth = 54−45 = 9"
