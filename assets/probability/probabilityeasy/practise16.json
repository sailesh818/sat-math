    "question": "1. A bag contains 4 red, 6 green, and 10 white balls. One ball is drawn at random. What is the probability it is green?",
    "options": ["6/20", "3/10", "1/4", "2/5"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Favorable / total",
    "explanation": "6 green out of 20 total = 6/20 = 3/10"

    "options": ["1/4", "1/2", "1/8", "3/4"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Probability = (1/2)^2",

    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Exclude 2 and 5 from total outcomes",

    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Count coffee lovers over total people",
    "explanation": "30/50 = 3/5"

    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Use the sum from the mean",
    "explanation": "Total sum = 4×5 = 20. Already 3 + 7 = 10 → x+y = 10"
