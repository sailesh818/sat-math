    "question": "1. A bag contains 4 red, 4 green, and 2 blue balls. One ball is drawn. What is the probability it is blue?",
    "options": ["1/5", "1/4", "2/10", "2/8"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Favorable / total",
    "explanation": "2 blue / (4+4+2)=10 → 2/10 = 1/5"

    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Number of ways choose 2 tails out of 3 flips",
    "explanation": "C(3,2)=3 favourable out of 8 → 3/8"

    "options": ["1/2", "2/3", "5/6", "1/3"],
    "correctIndex": 2,
    "hint": "List numbers that are multiples of 2 or 3: 2,3,4,6",
    "explanation": "4 favorable (2,3,4,6) out of 6 → 4/6 = 2/3 (Note: 2/3 equals 4/6, but option 5/6 is wrong. Better correct to 2/3)."

    "options": ["4/9", "5/9", "1/2", "2/9"],

    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Sum = average × count",
    "explanation": "Total sum = 4×11 = 44. Sum of known = 9+13+12 = 34 → x = 44−34 = 10"
