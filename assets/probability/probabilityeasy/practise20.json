    "question": "1. A bag contains 8 blue and 12 red balls. One ball is drawn at random. What is the probability it is red?",
    "options": ["12/20", "2/5", "3/5", "4/5"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Favorable / total",
    "explanation": "12 red / 20 total = 12/20 = 3/5"

    "question": "2. A coin is flipped and a die is rolled. What is the probability of getting Heads and a 5?",
    "options": ["1/12", "1/10", "1/6", "1/8"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Independent events: multiply probabilities",
    "explanation": "Coin = 1/2; die 5 = 1/6 → combined = 1/2 × 1/6 = 1/12"

  {
    "question": "3. A fair six‑sided die is rolled twice. What is the probability the sum of rolls is even?",
    "options": ["1/2", "1/3", "1/4", "2/3"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Half of possible sums are even",
    "explanation": "Out of 36 equally likely outcomes, 18 give even sum → probability = 1/2"

    "question": "4. A class of 25 students: 10 like physics, 12 like chemistry, 3 like both. If one student is chosen at random, what is the probability they like physics or chemistry?",
    "options": ["19/25", "22/25", "1", "17/25"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Use inclusion–exclusion: P(P or C) = P + C − P∩C",
    "explanation": "(10 + 12 − 3) / 25 = 19/25"

  {
    "question": "5. The mean of 10 numbers is 20. If two numbers 18 and 22 are replaced by 25 and 15 respectively, what is the new mean?",
    "options": ["20", "20.5", "19.8", "21"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Compute change in total sum then divide by count",
    "explanation": "Original sum = 200. Removed sum = 18+22=40. Add = 25+15=40. New total = 200 − 40 + 40 = 200 → mean remains 20"
