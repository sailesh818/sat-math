    "question": "1. A bag contains 10 balls: 4 red, 3 blue, and 3 yellow. If one ball is drawn, what is the probability that it is red or yellow?",
    "options": ["7/10", "4/10", "3/10", "1/2"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Add probabilities for red and yellow",
    "explanation": "Red + Yellow = 4 + 3 = 7 → 7/10"

    "question": "2. A fair six‑sided die is rolled. What is the probability of getting a 1, 2, or 3?",
    "options": ["1/2", "1/3", "1/4", "2/3"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Count favorable outcomes",
    "explanation": "3 out of 6 → 3/6 = 1/2"

    "question": "3. A coin is flipped three times. What is the probability of getting at least one head?",
    "options": ["7/8", "3/4", "1/2", "1/8"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Use complement: 1 − probability(all tails)",
    "explanation": "Probability all tails = (1/2)^3 = 1/8 → at least one head = 1 − 1/8 = 7/8"

  {
    "question": "4. The average of 6 numbers is 12. If two numbers are 10 and 14, what is the average of the remaining 4 numbers?",
    "options": ["12", "11", "13", "10"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "Compute total sum, subtract known, divide by remainder",
    "explanation": "Total sum = 72. Known sum = 24 → remaining = 48 → 48/4 = 12"

  {
    "question": "5. A bag contains 8 white and 2 black balls. Two balls are drawn with replacement. What is the probability both are black?",
    "options": ["1/25", "1/100", "4/25", "1/5"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "hint": "With replacement: (probability of black)^2",
    "explanation": "Probability black = 2/10 = 1/5 → squared = 1/25"
